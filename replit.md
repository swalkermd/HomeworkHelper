- `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Development

### Running the App
The app uses a proxy server architecture to handle both frontend and API:
- **Expo Dev Server**: Runs on port 8081 (internal)
- **Proxy Server**: Runs on port 5000 (exposed to browser)
  - Serves API endpoints at `/api/*`
  - Proxies frontend requests to Expo dev server on 8081

### Workflow
A workflow named `expo-dev-server` automatically starts both servers:
```bash
PORT=8081 npx expo start --web --port 8081 & sleep 3 && npx tsx server/proxy.ts
```

### Architecture
The proxy server (`server/proxy.ts`) provides:
- OpenAI API integration endpoints
- CORS handling
- Request proxying to Expo dev server
- All on port 5000 (the only port exposed in Replit webview)

### Key Dependencies
- `expo` ~54.0.22
- `react-native` 0.81.5
- `react` 19.1.0
- `openai` ^6.8.1
- `zustand` ^5.0.8

- `@react-navigation/native` ^7.1.19
- `react-native-reanimated` ^4.1.3
- `p-limit` ^7.2.0

## Recent Changes
- November 6, 2025: **SERVER-SIDE FORMATTING ENFORCEMENT** - Critical fix for math formatting:
  - Added server-side post-processing layer that forcefully converts ALL fractions to {num/den} format
  - Automatic decimal-to-fraction conversion (0.125→{1/8}, 0.25→{1/4}, 0.5→{1/2}, etc.) with boundary checks to avoid corrupting larger numbers
  - Converts inline fractions (1/8, 3/4) to vertical format {1/8}, {3/4} while preserving URLs and already-formatted fractions
  - Applied to all API endpoints: analyze-text, analyze-image, and ask-question
  - Enforces formatting on problem field, all step titles/content, and final answers
  - This server-side enforcement overrides any AI formatting mistakes before sending to client
- November 6, 2025: **OCR ACCURACY IMPROVEMENTS** - Enhanced image analysis:
  - Character-by-character transcription instructions with specific pattern examples
  - Explicit guidance for fraction coefficients before parentheses (e.g., "1/8(3d - 2)")
  - OCR double-check checklist before solving (fractions, parentheses, signs, squared terms)
  - Clear linear vs quadratic equation detection to use simplest method
  - Specific examples of common linear equation patterns from homework
  - Exact problem transcription required in response for verification
- November 6, 2025: **MAJOR UPDATE** - Comprehensive math formatting improvements:
  - All fractions now display in proper vertical format {num/den} - never inline or decimal
  - Color highlighting added: blue for operations being performed, red for results
  - No decimal conversions at any step unless explicitly requested
  - Improper fractions in final answers show both forms: {7/3} = 2{1/3}
  - Complete worked examples in AI prompts ensure consistent formatting
  - Enhanced step clarity with clear before/after states and highlighted changes
- November 6, 2025: Added automatic diagram generation with DALL-E 3 for visual problems (geometry, graphs, physics diagrams, charts)
- November 6, 2025: Initial MVP implementation complete
  - All core screens and navigation
  - AI integration with GPT-4o
  - MathText component for notation rendering
  - Progressive step reveal with animations
  - Follow-up Q&A chat functionality
  - Configured for Expo web on port 5000
